# Deploying a Static Site {#deploying-a-static-site}

The following guides are based on some shared assumptions:

- You are using the default build output location (`dist`). This location [can be changed using `build.outDir`](https://vitejs.dev/config/#build-outdir), and you can extrapolate instructions from these guides in that case.
- Vite is installed as a local dev dependency in your project, and you have setup the following npm scripts:
- You are using npm. You can use equivalent commands to run the scripts if you are using Yarn or other package managers.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

It is important to note that `vite preview` is intended for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production server.

::: tip NOTE
These guides provide instructions for performing a static deployment of your Vite site. Vite also has experimental support for Server Side Rendering. SSR refers to front-end frameworks that support running the same application in Node.js, pre-rendering it to HTML, and finally hydrating it on the client. Check out the [SSR Guide](./ssr) to learn about this feature. On the other hand, if you are looking for integration with traditional server-side frameworks, check out the [Backend Integration guide](./backend-integration) instead.

## Building The App {#building-the-app}

You may run `npm run build` command to build the app.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

By default, the build output will be placed at `dist`. You may deploy this `dist` folder to any of your preferred platforms.

### Testing The App Locally {#testing-the-app-locally}

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run preview
```

The `preview` command will boot up local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at http://localhost:5000. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

You may configure the port of the server py passing `--port` flag as an argument.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preview": "vite preview --port 8080"
  }
}
```

Now the `preview` method will launch the server at http://localhost:8080.

## GitHub Pages {#github-pages}

1. Set the correct `base` in `vite.config.js`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/`, you can omit `base` as it defaults to `'/'`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>/`, for example your repository is at `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`, then set `base` to `'/<REPO>/'`.

2. Inside your project, create `deploy.sh` with the following content (with highlighted lines uncommented appropriately), and run it to deploy:

   ```bash{13,20,23}
   #!/usr/bin/env sh

   # abort on errors
   set -e

   # build
   npm run build

   # navigate into the build output directory
   cd dist

   # if you are deploying to a custom domain
   # echo 'www.example.com' > CNAME

   git init
   git add -A
   git commit -m 'deploy'

   # if you are deploying to https://<USERNAME>.github.io
   # git push -f git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io.git master

   # if you are deploying to https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>
   # git push -f git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git master:gh-pages

   cd -
   ```

::: tip
You can also run the above script in your CI setup to enable automatic deployment on each push.

### GitHub Pages and Travis CI {#github-pages-and-travis-ci}

1. Set the correct `base` in `vite.config.js`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME or GROUP>.github.io/`, you can omit `base` as it defaults to `'/'`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME or GROUP>.github.io/<REPO>/`, for example your repository is at `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`, then set `base` to `'/<REPO>/'`.

2. Create a file named `.travis.yml` in the root of your project.

3. Run `npm install` locally and commit the generated lockfile (`package-lock.json`).

4. Use the GitHub Pages deploy provider template, and follow the [Travis CI documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/).

   ```yaml
   language: node_js
   node_js:
     - lts/*
   install:
     - npm ci
   script:
     - npm run build
   deploy:
     provider: pages
     skip_cleanup: true
     local_dir: dist
     # A token generated on GitHub allowing Travis to push code on you repository.
     # Set in the Travis settings page of your repository, as a secure variable.
     github_token: $GITHUB_TOKEN
     keep_history: true
     on:
       branch: master
   ```

## GitLab Pages and GitLab CI {#gitlab-pages-and-gitlab-ci}

1. Set the correct `base` in `vite.config.js`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME or GROUP>.gitlab.io/`, you can omit `base` as it defaults to `'/'`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME or GROUP>.gitlab.io/<REPO>/`, for example your repository is at `https://gitlab.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`, then set `base` to `'/<REPO>/'`.

2. Set `build.outDir` in `vite.config.js` to `public`.

3. Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your project with the content below. This will build and deploy your site whenever you make changes to your content:

   ```yaml
   image: node:10.22.0
   pages:
     cache:
       paths:
         - node_modules/
     script:
       - npm install
       - npm run build
     artifacts:
       paths:
         - public
     only:
       - master
   ```

## Netlify {#netlify}

1. On [Netlify](https://netlify.com), setup up a new project from GitHub with the following settings:

   - **Build Command:** `vite build` or `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`

2. Hit the deploy button.

## Google Firebase {#google-firebase}

1. Make sure you have [firebase-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-tools) installed.

2. Create `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc` at the root of your project with the following content:

   `firebase.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "hosting": {
       "public": "dist",
       "ignore": []
     }
   }
   ```

   `.firebaserc`:

   ```js
   {
    "projects": {
      "default": "<YOUR_FIREBASE_ID>"
    }
   }
   ```

3. After running `npm run build`, deploy using the command `firebase deploy`.

## Surge {#surge}

1. First install [surge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/surge), if you havenâ€™t already.

2. Run `npm run build`.

3. Deploy to surge by typing `surge dist`.

You can also deploy to a [custom domain](http://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain) by adding `surge dist yourdomain.com`.

## Heroku {#heroku}

1. Install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

2. Create a Heroku account by [signing up](https://signup.heroku.com).

3. Run `heroku login` and fill in your Heroku credentials:

   ```bash
   $ heroku login
   ```

4. Create a file called `static.json` in the root of your project with the below content:

   `static.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "root": "./dist"
   }
   ```

   This is the configuration of your site; read more at [heroku-buildpack-static](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static).

5. Set up your Heroku git remote:

   ```bash
   # version change
   $ git init
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "My site ready for deployment."

   # creates a new app with a specified name
   $ heroku apps:create example

   # set buildpack for static sites
   $ heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static.git
   ```

6. Deploy your site:

   ```bash
   # publish site
   $ git push heroku master

   # opens a browser to view the Dashboard version of Heroku CI
   $ heroku open
   ```

## Vercel {#vercel}

To deploy your Vite app with a [Vercel for Git](https://vercel.com/docs/git), make sure it has been pushed to a Git repository.

Go to https://vercel.com/import/git and import the project into Vercel using your Git of choice (GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket). Follow the wizard to select the project root with the project's `package.json` and override the build step using `npm run build` and the output dir to be `./dist`

![Override Vercel Configuration](../images/vercel-configuration.png)

After your project has been imported, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate Preview Deployments, and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly "main") will result in a Production Deployment.

Once deployed, you will get a URL to see your app live, such as the following: https://vite.vercel.app
